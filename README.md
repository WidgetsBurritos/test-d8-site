2. Clone your fork locally and change into that directory.
3. Install dependencies:

    ```
4. Do a basic site install based on the existing config:

## Notable Modules:

1. _my_testing_module_:
    Most of what we will be working with is located in a custom module called
    my_testing_module. Go to that module's [README](web/modules/custom/my_testing_module)
    to find out more information about what it does.

2. _simpletest_:
    This module is provided by Drupal core. This test will be used for kernel,
    functional, and javascript tests. It also provides a UI in the admin panel
    that can be used to run tests (although we will be focused on test running
    via the command line).
